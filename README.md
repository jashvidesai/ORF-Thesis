This repository contains code supporting the thesis Exact and Heuristic Optimization Methods for the Transportation of Radiopharmaceuticals.

Chapter Code Mapping:

Chapters 3–4 (Mathematical Model & Exact Methods):
Code for the mixed-integer programming (MIP) model implemented using Gurobi can be found in the VRPGurobiOptimization/ folder.

Chapter 4 (Exponential Verification Experiment):
The script used to test the exponential scaling of exact methods is located in ExponentialVerification.py.

Chapters 5–6 (Heuristic Approach with ALNS):
The full implementation of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic is located in the ALNS/ folder.

AI Assistance Acknowledgement: Portions of the Python code were developed with the assistance of AI tools particularly for refining syntax.
